### `*args`
- **Purpose**: Allows a function to accept a variable number of positional arguments.
- **Type**: Collected as a tuple.
- **Usage**: Useful when you want to pass an arbitrary number of arguments to a function.

**Example**:
```python
def example(*args):
    print(args)

example(1, 2, 3)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)
```

### `**kwargs`
- **Purpose**: Allows a function to accept a variable number of keyword arguments (key-value pairs).
- **Type**: Collected as a dictionary.
- **Usage**: Useful when you want to pass an arbitrary number of named arguments to a function.

**Example**:
```python
def example(**kwargs):
    print(kwargs)

example(name="Alice", age=30)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
```

### Summary
- `*args` captures additional positional arguments as a tuple.
- `**kwargs` captures additional keyword arguments as a dictionary. 

Both are useful for creating flexible functions that can handle varying numbers of inputs.

In Python, a `lambda` function is an anonymous function that can have any number of input parameters but can only have one expression. It's a way to create small, single-use functions without formally defining them using `def`. A `lambda` function is often used in situations where a simple function is needed for a short period.

### Syntax:
```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

- **`arguments`**: The input parameters of the lambda function.
- **`expression`**: The single line of code that will be executed and returned.

### Example:

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
```

In this example:
- `lambda x, y: x + y` creates a function that takes two arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum.
- The lambda function is assigned to the variable `add`, and calling `add(3, 5)` returns 8.

### Comparison to a Regular Function:
The above lambda function is equivalent to:

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
```

### Use Cases:
- **Higher-order functions**: Lambdas are often used with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, or `sorted()` that take another function as an argument.
  
  Example using `sorted()`:
  ```python
  points = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (5, -1)]
  sorted_points = sorted(points, key=lambda point: point[1])
  print(sorted_points)  # Output: [(5, -1), (3, 1), (1, 2)]
  ```

  Here, `lambda point: point[1]` is used to sort a list of tuples based on the second value in each tuple.

### Key Points:
- Lambdas are limited to a single expression, which is automatically returned.
- They are useful when you need small, throwaway functions.
- They help keep the code concise but can reduce readability if overused.
